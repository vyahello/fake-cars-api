# Mock vehicles API
>A lightweight fake vehicle API written in [API Star](https://docs.apistar.com/) ðŸŒŸ python WEB API toolkit framework. 
>This project is built only as a sample REST API toolkit.
>
>Fake data was generated from cool https://www.mockaroo.com source.
>
> You can try it out at [https://fake-vehicles-api.herokuapp.com](https://fake-vehicles-api.herokuapp.com) as it is deployed on heroku.

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/vyahello/fake-vehicles-api/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/vyahello/fake-vehicles-api?branch=master)

## Tools/features
> - `python 3.8`
> - `RESTful API`
> - `pytest`
> - `travis CI`
> - `heroku`

In addition it is `fully type annotated` and covered with bunch of static code analysis tools like `mypy`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `pydocstyle` and `black`.

## Usage
Run next command from the root of the project:
```bash
~ python vehicle_api.py
```

After please open [localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) or [localhost:5000/index.html](http://localhost:5000/index.html) path in your browser to obtain home page. 
It will show you a page with available endpoints and usage details:

## Development

### API endpoints
There are several endpoints already developed (others will be added soon):
  - `GET` request on `/api` endpoint to get list of all vehicles e.g:
    > `curl localhost:5000/api`
  - `POST` request on `/api` endpoint to create a vehicle e.g:
    > `curl -X POST \` \
    `-H "Content-type: application/json \"` \
    `-d {"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \` \
    `localhost:5000/api`
  - `GET` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to get single vehicle e.g:
    > `curl localhost:5000/api/99`
  - `PUT` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to update single vehicle e.g:
    > `curl -X PUT \` \
    `-H "Content-type: application/json" \` \
    `-d '{"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \` \
    `localhost:5000/api/99`
  - `DELETE` request on `/api/{id}` to delete single vehicle e.g:
    > `curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/api/99`

### Testing
Project is covered with both **_unittests_** on code basis and **_functional_** tests on REST API endpoints with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) testing framework.
It uses [pytest.ini](pytest.ini) configuration file.

Please run next command from the root directory to start testing:
```bash
~ pytest
```
> If you would like to run only `smoke` tests or `unittests` please run tests with corresponding marker e.g:
> 
>`~ pytest -m smoke`

Please open `test-report.html` file in your browser to see testing report.

### Debugging
In case of code debugging please use contemporary [pdb++](https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp) package as an easy-way to track your code.
It is wrapper of a builtin [pbd](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html) package but with features extensions.

To make it work just install it from `requirements-dev.txt` file and use [breakpoint()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#breakpoint) function call e.g:
```python
class A:    
    def do_debug(self) -> None:
        self_: "A" = self
        breakpoint()

a: A = A()
a.do_debug()
```

To be able debug your application please pass `debug=True` parameter into `Setup` object while running an app e.g:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    _run_vehicle_api(Setup(debug=True))
```

### Heroku deployment
Please follow instructions from - https://python-responder.org/en/latest/deployment.html
