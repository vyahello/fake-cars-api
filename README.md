### Quick start

Please run next commands to start an app:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aiopymake/fake-vehicles-api.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m api
```

Then please open [localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) path in your browser to obtain home page. 

## Development notes

### API endpoints
There are several endpoints already developed (others will be added soon):
  - `GET` request on `/api` endpoint to get list of all vehicles e.g:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:5000/api
    ```
  - `POST` request on `/api` endpoint to create a vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
     curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json \"
    -d {"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \
    localhost:5000/api
    ```
  - `GET` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to get single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:5000/api/99
    ```
  - `PUT` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to update single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \
    localhost:5000/api/99
    ```
  - `DELETE` request on `/api/{id}` to delete single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/api/99
    ```

### Testing
Project is covered with both **_unit_** and **_functional_** tests on REST API endpoints using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) testing framework.

Please run next command from the root directory to start testing:
```bash
pytest
```

Run only smoke tests:
```bash
pytest -m smoke
```

Run only unit tests:
```bash
pytest -m unittests
```

Please open `test-report.html` file in your browser to see testing report.
