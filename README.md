# Fake Vehicles API
> A lightweight fake vehicle API written in [API Star](https://docs.apistar.com/) ðŸŒŸ python WEB API toolkit framework. 
> This project is built only as a sample REST API toolkit.
>
> Fake data was generated from cool https://www.mockaroo.com source.


## Tools
- `python 3.8`
- `RESTful API`
- `pytest`
- `travis CI`
- `heroku`

In addition it is `fully type annotated` and covered with bunch of static code analysis tools like `mypy`, `flake8`, `pylint`, `pydocstyle` and `black`.

## Usage

### Quick start

Run next command from the root directory of the project:
```bash
python -m api
```

After please open [localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/) or [localhost:5000/index.html](http://localhost:5000/index.html) path in your browser to obtain home page. 

## Development notes

### API endpoints
There are several endpoints already developed (others will be added soon):
  - `GET` request on `/api` endpoint to get list of all vehicles e.g:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:5000/api
    ```
  - `POST` request on `/api` endpoint to create a vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
     curl -X POST \
    -H "Content-type: application/json \"
    -d {"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \
    localhost:5000/api
    ```
  - `GET` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to get single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:5000/api/99
    ```
  - `PUT` request on `/api/{id}` endpoint to update single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl -X PUT \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{"manufacturer": "BMW", "model": "X5", "year": 2011, "vin": "WBAWV53589P465532"}' \
    localhost:5000/api/99
    ```
  - `DELETE` request on `/api/{id}` to delete single vehicle e.g:
    ```bash
    curl -X DELETE localhost:5000/api/99
    ```

### Testing
Project is covered with both **_unittests_** and **_functional_** tests on REST API endpoints using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest) testing framework.

Please run next command from the root directory to start testing:
```bash
pytest
```
> If you would like to run only `smoke` tests or `unittests` please run tests with corresponding marker e.g:
> 
> ```bash
> pytest -m smoke
> ```

Please open `test-report.html` file in your browser to see testing report.
